# dateStructure
 This code contains work with structures. In this assignment I worked with Dates. There are several functions to work with Dates:
 
 1. isValidDate(): This function should validate whether a date is valid or not. Ensure that the date is within reasonable ranges for day, month, and year. 
 
 2. newDate(int d, int m, int y): This function should update the values of variable in Date structure.
 
 3. getDayOfWeek(): This function should calculate and return the day of the week for a date. You may choose any suitable algorithm for this calculation. 
 
 4. calculateDifference(const Date& date): This function should calculate the difference in days between two dates and return the result. 
 
 5. printDate(): This function should print the date in a readable format, such as "January 1, 2023".
 
 6. operator<(const Date& date): This comparison operator is used to compare two dates according to year, month and day.
 7. sortByDate(): This functions allows user to sort dates in chronological order.
